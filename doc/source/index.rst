Welcome to Virtual Watershed Adaptors and Model Integration documentation!

Python API for Dynamic Waterhsed Science Modeling

The Virtual Watershed is an extension of the 
`GSToRE architecture <http://gstore.unm.edu/docs/index.html>`_ hosted by the
Earth Data Analysis Center at the University of New Mexico. It is a specialized
database for hydrological data. By properly utilizing metadata, we may, for 
example, very intuitively create multiple "model runs", where a given 
hydrological model or coupled hydrological models operate on a set of input 
data. This input data may then be modified, fed to another model run, with 
new outputs, and all this may be stored sanely. In the future we will also 
be assigning multiple model runs into some sort of "project run" structure.
